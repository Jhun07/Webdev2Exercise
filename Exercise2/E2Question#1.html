    <h1>My College Life</h1>
    <p>
        Eversince, I always thought that college life is <b>easy</b> and <b>fun</b> . Choosing your <b>desired career
        </b> is one way ticket to be succesful.
        I am so excited to went through these stages and experience those <b>unkabogable memories</b> they've said. When
        <b>PN</b> chose me to be part of their scholarship, it's like a <b>dream come true</b> to me since I was able to
        continue my <b>education</b>.
        Considering the situation that my <b>family</b> has. Yes, I am one of those <b>underprivelged students</b> who
        used <b>capabilites</b> as a ticket to achieve <b>college education</b>. To inform everyone, PN caters all the
        necessities except for the <b>allowance</b>.
        I am so <b>blessed</b> to be part of this opportunity. Basically, PN only provides <b>Computer Certificate Of
            Technology</b>. One of the in demand course nowadays.
        To clarify, <b>IT</b> is really not my first choice and never been my dream course before but I am
        <b>destined</b> to here. At first, I keep on asking myself where am I? What should I have done? Why all these
        things happening to me rightnow? Yes, that's all I thought once then.
        But everything was <b>changed</b> after I realized <b>something</b>. This qouted line: "Kaya man gani nila! Ako
        pa kaha! Kulang lng jud guro ko ug practice." So I changed my <b>study habits</b> and I figure out these
        <b>strategies</b> really work. Thankfully, I am now starting <b>loving</b> IT.
